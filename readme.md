## Description

This WordPress plugin adds a Tax ID field to WooCommerce Registration, Account, and Checkout. If a Tax ID is set, it removes taxes from cart and checkout. If the Tax ID is not set, it will display a notice prompting the logged-in user to enter a Tax ID. If the user is not logged in, the user will be prompted to log in or create an account to enter a Tax ID.

## Installation
Upload the ```wholesaler-taxes``` folder to the ```/wp-content/plugins/``` directory then activate through the Plugins dashboard in WordPress.
